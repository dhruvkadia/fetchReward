# fetchReward

# Assumptions while developing the logic
1. The texts are compared word by word along with their position to detemine if they are exact match or not.
2. No libraries or packages have been used to clean the text. Basic string functions and most common available contracting words and stop words are used to clean the texts.
3. The code is built keeping in mind the 3 samples provided. It can be enhanced using libraries like NLTK to clean more sets of stop words.


# Run Instructions
The code was developed using jupyter notebook, same can be use to execute code. Please follow below steps:
1. Just import the .ipynb in the notebook and run all the cells. 
2. Text1 and Text2 contains the string to be compared. Please replace it with other text to test the other use cases.
3. A .py file is also uploaded in case Jupyter notebook is not available to run the code. You can use the following command in terminal to run the code. 
python FetchRewards.py
